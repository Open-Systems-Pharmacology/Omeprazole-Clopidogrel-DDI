# Omeprazole-Clopidogrel-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Omeprazole-Clopidogrel-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the clopidogrel model regarding the omeprazole-clopidogrel-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied omeprazole model has been published previously [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/12/12/1191)]. For further details and documentation please refer to [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/5/915)].

## Version information

PK-Sim Version 9.1.
